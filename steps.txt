1. create express server
2. server statict html file
3.install and require socket.io
4. create a io var by passing server to socket funtion()
the way it works is tha socket.io is sitting on the server wating orclient/browser to make connection with the server
basically server side endpoint

5. out of two sockets(endpoint) one is in the app.js(server), the other needs to be the client so we will create another socket for static html file
by including socket.io library by using cdn link

6. then create a separate js file an in it 
create another socket variable  and use io.connect on the local host;
